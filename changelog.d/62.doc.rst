Improved documentation clarity and usability:

* Updated external links for `uv`, `towncrier`, `reStructuredText`, Sphinx, `jing`, and RNC schema to official resources.
* Removed `$` prefixes from shell command examples for easier copy-pasting.
* Added a brief explanation for the `--frozen` flag usage with `uv sync`.
* Enhanced descriptions and added links in the "External tools" section.
