Fix doc warnings from Sphinx

* Have Sphinx warnings written to :file:`docs/sphinx-warnings.log`.
* Disable ``inherited-members`` option (it creates warnings from a different docstring format).
* Slightly restructured Reference guide a bit. "Docbuild CLI" is on the top level now, making :file:`modules.rst` obsolete.
*  Fix some ReST problems in :file:`checks.py` docstrings (mainly missing linebreaks)
