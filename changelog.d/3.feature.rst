Implement cloning of Git repositories

All repos are "bare" clones, meaning they do not have a working directory.
This was needed to avoid issues with branches.

The internal logic is available through some CLI commands:

* :command:`docbuild repo clone` - Clone a repository into the permanent storage.
  With the help of the :class:`~docbuild.cli.models.repo.Repo` class,
  it can handle different notations of repositories, such as HTTP URLs, SSH URLS, or abbreviated URLs (like ``gh://org/repo``).
* :command:`docbuild repo dir` - Shows the directory path for permanent storage.
  This is useful for debugging and manual operations.
* :command:`docbuild repo list` - List all repositories in the permanent storage.
