"""CLI interface to build a document.

A document (or "doctype") consists of ``[PRODUCT]/[DOCSET][@LIFECYCLES]/LANGS``
with the following properties:

\b

* (Optional) ``PRODUCT`` is the product. To mark "ALL" products, omit the
  product or use "*"
* (Optional) ``DOCSET`` is the docset, usually the version or release of
  a product.
  To mark "ALL" docsets, omit the docset or use ``"*"``.
* (Optional) ``LIFECYCLES`` marks a list of lifecycles separated by comma
  or pipe symbol.
  A lifecycle can be one of the values 'supported', 'unsupported', 'beta',
  or 'hidden'.
* ``LANGS`` marks a list of languages separated by comma. Every single
  language contains a LANGUAGE-COUNTRY syntax, for example 'en-us', 'de-de' etc.

Examples of the doctypes syntax:

\b

* ``"//en-us"``
  Builds all supported deliverables for English
* ``"sles/*/en-us"``
  Builds only SLES deliverables which are supported and in English
* ``"sles/*@unsupported/en-us,de-de"``
  Builds all English and German SLES releases which are unsupported
* ``"sles/@beta|supported/de-de"``
  Build all docsets that are supported and beta for German SLES.
* ``"sles/@beta,supported/de-de"``
  Same as the previous one, but with comma as the separator between
  the lifecycle states.
